# Food delivery

## General Information
* Project Description:
The Food Delivery project is a system that allows users to order food from various restaurants and have it delivered to their location. The system supports two main roles: Restaurant Managers and Customers.
* Restaurant Manager's Functions:
* Menu and Food Management:
 Restaurant managers have the ability to add, edit, and delete dishes in their menu. Each dish includes details such as name, price, description, image, and category (e.g., main course, beverages, desserts).
* Order Management:
  They can view a list of orders placed at their restaurant and update the status of each order (preparing, delivered, paid, etc.).
* Invoice Management:
 Restaurant managers can generate invoices for orders, including itemized lists of dishes ordered and their total cost.
* Customer's Functions:
* Browsing and Ordering: Customers can browse menus from various restaurants, select dishes, and add them to their shopping cart. They can view the details of each dish, including its name, description, price, and image.
* Checkout: Once they have selected their desired dishes, customers can proceed to checkout. During this process, they provide their delivery address and contact information. They can also review their order, apply discounts or coupons, and make payments.
* Account Management: Customers have the option to create accounts where they can save their delivery addresses, contact details, and order history. They can also update their personal information and track the status of their current orders.
* Project Goals: The primary objective of this project is to enhance coding skills and problem-solving abilities. It also aims to create a practical application for food delivery, providing convenience to customers and restaurant managers alike
